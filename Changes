1.0.0  2025-04-18T20:45:15-05:00
    - MAJOR CHANGES:
    - IMPORTANT: This version removes all 'provides' options other
        than the brief descriptive text in the hidden file.
    - Removed ALL code for reactions with existing distributions
        and moved it to upcoming new distribution 'App::DistroLint'.

    - Added new file 'RepoChanges' to give full details of the
        modifications to the original files generated by app 'mi6'.
    - Corrected improper handling of the conflicting 'provides' data
        between this distro vs META6.json; this supplies the META6.json's
        'description' key's value as well as in the README.md file.
    - Improved t/load test (thanks @finanalyst).
    - Replaced module 'RakupodObject' with 'Pod::Load'.
    - Updated App::Mi6 version requirement to v3.0.6.

        modules for more pre-compiled code.
