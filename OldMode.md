  * old ***NOT YET IMPLEMENTED***

    Inspects an existing Git repository of a Raku module to help convert it to one that uses the `App::Mi6` module with the Zef repository. Essentially all it does is add or modify the following files:

      * Changes

      * dist.ini

      * README.md

      * .github/workflows/*.yml
