Desired capabilities
====================

Use straight lint sub with no .precomp to check META6.json
  files versus /resources to ensure they're in sync

First priority is to check synch between actual 'use'd modules
and and those in the META6.json file.
  + remove or add to the META6.json file as required
  + first save the META6.json file before any changes

New creations should have a RunBeforeBuild script
  to ensure /resources and META6.json match
  + and appropriate subs to show and download /resources
    payloads. See Foo::Bar for an example.

Implement old= mode
  + use a config file
    My-Module.yml
      # contents?

Implement lint mode
  + Consider using Shell::Command 
  + ensure there is a load test for
    ALL files in /lib

Add option to new= to add a Resources
  module
  + user-selected name (below top level)

Add a new= method with a config file
  instead of the hidden file
  + deprecate the hidden file method
  + the config file
    <name>.yml
    My-Module.yml
      name: My::Module
      provides: Blah blah
