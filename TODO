Before release:

Fix this mess, it no longer does the new stuff!!

DONE: Tidy docs
  # from wayland76:
  make credits into links

DONE: Find where we call mi6: empty dir check MUST be done there!!!

DONE: DO NOT ALLOW EXECUTION FOR AN EXISTING BASE DIRECTORY
      WITH CONTENT

DONE:
  Delay adding a time-delay to yes/no response. Instead,
  add a -force option to do without a hidden file.
