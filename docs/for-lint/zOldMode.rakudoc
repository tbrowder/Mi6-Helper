old  ***NOT YET IMPLEMENTED***

Inspects an existing Git repository of a Raku module to help convert
it to one that uses the C<App::Mi6> module with the Zef
repository. Essentially all it does is add, modify, or suggest
changes to the following
files:

    =item Changes
    =item dist.ini
    =item README.md
    =item .github/workflows/*.yml

=end item

=end pod
