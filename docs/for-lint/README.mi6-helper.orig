=head1 NAME

B<Mi6::Helper> - An aid for converting Raku modules to use B<App::Mi6>
                 and checking Raku module repos for errors

=head1 SYNOPSIS

NOTE: This version removes all 'provides' methods except
      the use of the hidden file.

=begin code
use Mi6::Helper
$ mi6-helper new=Foo::Bar  # Uses the 'provides' text in hidden file 
                           # '.Foo-Bar'
    or

$ mi6-helper lint <dir>    # Checks a module directory for errors
                           # and best practice recommendations
=end code

Alternatively, one can use either of two programs as short names for
the lint mode:

=begin code
$ distro-lint <dir>
$ dlint <dir>
=end code

B<Easily> create the template for a new Raku module repository for
management by C<App::Mi6> with modifications including:

=item Publishing in the B<Zef> Raku module ecosystem
=item User choice of the 'provides' text
=item C<README.md> file source removed from the base module and placed in a new C<docs/README.rakudoc> file
=item Using three separate OS tests in C<.github/workflows> and shows results of each in the C<README.md> file
=item A new C<lint> mode to check existing module repos for possible issues
including ensuring the META6.json file reflects the file names in the 
/resources directory and the dependencies match the modules' entries
in 'lib' entries.

See published module C<Foo::Bar> for an example of a module created by 
C<mi6-helper>.

=head2 Special installation requirements

The user must install and have an account with C<fez> to use this module to 
create a new module repository:

=begin code
zef install fez
fez register
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Note this module has changed significantly since
the author has had much more experience using B<App::Mi6>.  For
example, discovering that accidentally using C<mi6 test> in a non-mi6 module's base
directory will corrupt an existing README.md file! (See 'App::Mi6'
issue \#157.)

B<CAUTION>: Before using this tool on a real module repository, the
user should ensure all contents have been comitted with Git to enable
recovery from any unwanted changes.

This module installs a Raku executable named C<mi6-helper> which is
designed for the following modes of operation:

=head2 lint

=begin item
lint \<path\>

Checks the module repository in directory \<path\> that
the contents of the "resources" list in the 'META6.json' file
and the distibution's './resources' directory agree. Modifies them as 
necessary, displays the proposed changes, and prompts the user for 
permission to make the changes.

Also checks for other configuration improvement possibilities.
Note the 'lint' mode will work in repos I<not> under App::Mi6 management.

Leaves a report of actions taken and suggestions for improvement in
the same directory. The report is named 'mi6-helper-lint.txt'.

The items checked in this version include:
=item2 Discrepancies in the META6.json file
=item2 Obsolete file name conventions: .t, .pl, .pm, .p6, .pl6, .pm6, .pod, .pod6
=item2 Use of 'perl6' instead of 'raku' in script 'shebang' lines 
=item2 Use of CI testing using 'zef' instead of 'prove6'
=item2 Use of Github for version archiving
=end item

=head2 new

=begin item
new=X dir=Y

Creates a new module 'X' in parent directory 'Y' (default '.') using
B<mi6> and then changes some of the files and directories to satisfy the 'docs'
option and, optionally, substitute 'blah...' with the user's short
description (if it is provided).

Provides a final C<mi6 build> and C<git commit -a -m"initial commit">
so the new repository is ready to C<git push <remote> <branch>>
and C<mi6 release>.

CAUTION: If file C<dist.ini> already exists in the parent directory, the program
will abort B<unless> the C<force> option is used. Use the C<force> option at your
own risk!

=end item

B<NOTE>: If one of the non-Linux OS tests fail, you can eliminate that test by doing
the following two steps (for example, remove the C<macos> test):

=item Move the C<macos.yml> file out of the C<.github/workflows/> directory (the 
author uses a subdir named C<dev> to hold such things).
=item Put a semicolon in the C<dist.ini> file to comment out the line naming the C<macos.yml> file

=head2 Modified files for mode B<new>

See L<NewMode|NewMode.md> for details of each changed line.

=head3 Files with replaced, modified, or added lines:

=begin code

  dist.ini:
    # The line that reads:
    filename = lib/Foo/Bar.rakumod
    # is changed to:
    filename = docs/README.rakudoc
    # the following App::Mi6 optional sections are added
    # if not found:
    #   PruneFiles
    #   MetaNoIndex
    #   AutoScanPackages
    #   RunBeforeBuild
    #   RunAfterBuild


  META6.json:
    # The line that begins:
    "description": "blah blah blah",
    # is changed to:
    "description": "[text entered per the 'provides=X' option]

  lib/Foo/Bar.rakumod:
    # Move all lines following the first non-blank line
    # thus leaving:
    unit class Foo::Bar;

  .github/workflows/test.yml:
    # Create three new files to provide three separate test badges
    .github/workflows/linux.yml
    .github/workflows/windows.yml
    .github/workflows/macos.yml
    # Remove the original test.yml file

=end code

=head3 New directory and file:

=begin code

  # new directory
  docs/
    # new file:
    README.rakudoc
    # This new file first gets all the lines removed from
    # 'lib/Foo/Bar.rakumod' resulting in a complete pod
    # document:
    =begin pod
       ...
    =end pod
    # Then, four lines are changed:

    # 1. The line that begins:
    Foo::Bar - blah blah blah
    # is changed to either:
    B<Foo::Bar> - [Foo::Bar is bolded, text entered per the 'provides=X' option]
    # or:
    B<Foo::Bar> - blah blah blah [Foo::Bar is bolded]

    # 2. The line that begins:
    Foo::Bar is ...
    # is changed to:
    B<Foo::Bar> is ...

    # 3. The line that begins:
    Copyright {current year} ...
    # is changed to:
    <copyright symbol> {current year} ...

    # 4. The line that reads:
