This is a new Mi6-mananged module create with the following data:

==========================
App::Mi6 version:

$ zef list --installed | grep App::Mi6
App::Mi6:ver<2.0.7>:auth<cpan:SKAJI>

$ say (run("git config --global user.name", :out).out.spurt.chomp)
"Tom Browder"

$ say (run("git config --global user.email", :out).out.spurt.chomp)
"tbrowder@acm.org"
==========================

That resulted in the following data to be replaced by ("Mi6::Helper")/bin/mi6-helper:

Foo-Bar/
  # Files with replaced, modified, or added lines:
  dist.ini:
    # The line that reads:
    filename = lib/Foo/Bar.rakumod
    # is changed to:
    filename = docs/README.rakudoc

  META6.json:
    # The line that begins:
    "description": "blah blah blah",
    # is changed to:
    "description": "[text entered per the 'provides=X' option]

  lib/Foo/Bar.rakumod:
    # Move all lines following the first non-blank line
    # thus leaving:
    unit class Foo::Bar;

  # new directory
  docs/
    # new file:
    README.rakudoc
    # This new file first gets all the lines removed from
    # 'lib/Foo/Bar.rakumod' resulting in a complete pod
    # documement:
    =begin pod
       ...
    =end pod
    # Then, four lines are changed:

    # 1. The line that begins:
    Foo::Bar - blah blah blah
    # is changed to either:
    B<Foo::Bar> - [Foo::Bar is bolded, text entered per the 'provides=X' option]
    # or:
    B<Foo::Bar> - blah blah blah [Foo::Bar is bolded]

    # 2. The line that begins:
    Foo::Bar is ...
    # is changed to:
    B<Foo::Bar> is ...

    # 3. The line that begins:
    Copyright {current year} ...
    # is changed to:
    <copyright symbol> {current year} ...

    # 4. The line that reads:

    # is changed to better English::
